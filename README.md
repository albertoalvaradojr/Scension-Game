Developed a Directional UI element that directs the player to where the Objective is. As well, modified a MiniMap plugin and made it my own. Also, added a Fullmap Logic.

<h2>
  Combat Meter
</h2>
Combat meter that lets the player know when the player is free of combat. Once he is damaged the progess meter goes to zero and slowly increases until it reaches the no combat status. As well, the Health number inside the circle is synced with the health bar the the player can know exactly how much health they have.

<h2>
  Security System
</h2>



Security system that you can construct that lets your team know when an enemy has entered your controlling arena. UI Indicators will let you know the second the enemy passes the security gates.

<h2>Blessed Status Logic</h2>

<br>
Blessed Status allows player to enter the Boss arena and automatically teleports their team inside. You cannot use abilities while Blessed and once you die or get downed, the status goes away. I synced the status to the UI and added in A VFX that was created by one of the artist of the team. All players will know how many players are blessed.
